# Enhanced Terminal Integration for Render.com

This directory contains files to automatically integrate the Enhanced Terminal Environment with your Render.com deployment.

## Quick Start

1. Run the direct installer:
   ```bash
   ./render_integration/direct_installer.sh
   ```

2. Add the enhanced terminal package to your repository:
   ```bash
   cp enhanced-terminal-v1.0.tar.gz .
   ```

3. Commit and push changes:
   ```bash
   git add enhanced-terminal-v1.0.tar.gz Dockerfile.flask flask_server.py render.yaml user_scripts/setup-enhanced-linux startup_script.sh
   git commit -m "Add enhanced terminal with automatic setup for Render.com"
   git push
   ```

4. Deploy to Render.com

## Components

- `direct_installer.sh`: Script that modifies necessary files for integration
- `startup_script.sh`: Script that runs when the container starts
- `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`: Detailed guide for deploying to Render.com
- `render.yaml`: Enhanced render.yaml file with environment variables

## What This Does

1. When the container starts:
   - The startup script extracts the enhanced terminal package
   - Sets up the environment in the container

2. When a user connects:
   - The user environment setup function calls setup-enhanced-linux
   - This sets up the enhanced commands in the user's home directory

This ensures all users automatically get access to the enhanced terminal environment.

## For More Information

See `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for detailed deployment instructions.
