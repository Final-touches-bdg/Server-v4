# Enhanced Terminal Environment - Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure your deployment is properly configured.

## Pre-Deployment

- [ ] Run the direct installer: `./render_integration/direct_installer.sh`
- [ ] Copy enhanced terminal package: `cp enhanced-terminal-v1.0.tar.gz .`
- [ ] Verify `startup_script.sh` is copied to repository root
- [ ] Verify `setup-enhanced-linux` script is created in user_scripts
- [ ] Confirm all scripts are executable

## Commit and Push

- [ ] Add all modified files to git:
  ```
  git add enhanced-terminal-v1.0.tar.gz Dockerfile.flask flask_server.py render.yaml user_scripts/setup-enhanced-linux startup_script.sh
  ```
- [ ] Commit changes with descriptive message
- [ ] Push to repository

## Render.com Deployment

- [ ] Create new Web Service (or select existing)
- [ ] Set environment to Docker
- [ ] Connect to repository/branch with enhanced terminal changes
- [ ] Set environment variables (if using custom settings)
- [ ] Deploy service

## Verification

After deployment, connect to your terminal and verify:

- [ ] Connect successfully to terminal
- [ ] Run `ls` and see color output
- [ ] Run `help` to see enhanced help system
- [ ] Try package commands like `pkg list-installed`
- [ ] Test text editors like `nano` or `vim`

If something isn't working:

1. Check logs in Render.com dashboard
2. Ensure enhanced-terminal-v1.0.tar.gz was included in deployment
3. Try running `setup-enhanced-linux` manually
4. Verify startup_script.sh is being executed

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:

1. **Missing enhanced terminal package**: Make sure enhanced-terminal-v1.0.tar.gz is in repository root
2. **Permission issues**: Ensure all scripts have executable permissions
3. **Path problems**: Check if ~/.local/bin is in PATH
4. **Startup script not running**: Check container logs for errors

## Maintenance

To update the enhanced terminal environment:

1. Update enhanced-terminal-v1.0.tar.gz with new version
2. Re-deploy to Render.com
